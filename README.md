Hello! I am Felix and this was my very first project I was able to complete.

This is a copycat of an already existent website: [goabstract.com](https://help.goabstract.com/hc/en-us).

I have changed a few things on the website such as images, styling and formatting of a few elements.

Since this website was made with a Framework, I decided to give it a shot and replicate it only using HTML and CSS.

This project took about a week to acomplish. A few tweeks here and there and I was pretty happy with the final result.

Check it out!
